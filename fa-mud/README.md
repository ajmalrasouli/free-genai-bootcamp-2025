## **Vocabulary Files** 
The game uses JSON files to load Farsi vocabulary. Example:

    "translation": "book",
    "pos": "noun",
    "category": "object",
    "example": "Take the Ú©ØªØ§Ø¨ from the shelf."

    "translation": "wolf",
    "pos": "noun",
    "category": "animal",
    "example": "A Ú¯Ø±Ú¯ growls nearby."
  }
]
```

Place your vocabulary files in the `data/` folder and specify the file when launching the game: 
```bash
python main.py --vocab data/words.json
```
