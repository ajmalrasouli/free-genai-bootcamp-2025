### Functional Requirements ⚙️ (What the company needs):

*   💰 The company wants to own its own AI system, rather than renting one.
*   🔒 This is because they're worried about user data privacy and future high costs of using online AI services.
*   🖥️ They want to buy an "AI PC" (powerful computer for AI) costing £10,000 - £15,000.
*   🧑‍🎓 They have 300 students using the system, all located in Nagasaki.


### Assumptions 🤔 (What we think is true):

*   💻 We believe open-source AI models can be powerful enough to run on a computer costing £10,000 - £15,000.
*   🌐 We're assuming our office internet connection will be fast enough for 300 students to use the AI system at the same time.


### Data Strategy 🗄️ (How we'll handle data):

*   ©️ We're worried about using copyrighted material.
*   📚 So, we'll buy and store our own materials to use with the AI.


### Considerations 💡(What we're thinking about):

*   ✅ We're thinking about using IBM Granite because it's truly open-source.
*   🕵️ Its training data is traceable, which helps avoid copyright problems and lets us understand how the model works.
