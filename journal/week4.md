## **March 12, 2025: Improving Farsi Text Display**

### **Issue: Disconnected Farsi Letters**
When implementing the Farsi Text Adventure MUD, we encountered a significant challenge with displaying Farsi text properly in the terminal interface. Farsi letters were appearing in the correct order but weren't connecting to each other as they should in proper Farsi script. This made the text difficult to read and detracted from the immersive experience we wanted to create.

### **Diagnosis:**
1. The primary issue stemmed from incorrect ordering of text processing operations:
   - We were normalizing text first, then reshaping, which disrupted character connections
   - The default arabic_reshaper configuration wasn't optimized for Farsi
   - Multiple RTL marks were causing text misalignments

2. The text processing was inconsistent across different components:
   - Each class (Item, NPC, Room, GameLog) had its own implementation
   - Different approaches to RTL/LTR handling caused inconsistencies

### **Solution Implemented:**

1. **Centralized Text Processing:**
   - Created a unified `normalize_farsi` function in vocabulary_loader.py
   - Made this function accessible to all components that need to process Farsi text
   - Ensured consistent text handling throughout the application

2. **Optimized Processing Order:**
   - Changed the processing order to:
     1. Remove any existing RTL/LTR marks
     2. Normalize using hazm
     3. Reshape with custom configuration
     4. Apply BIDI algorithm

3. **Custom ArabicReshaper Configuration:**
   - Implemented a specialized configuration for Farsi text:
   ```python
   configuration = {
       'delete_harakat': False,
       'support_ligatures': True,
       'language': 'Farsi',
       'use_unshaped_instead_of_isolated': True
   }
   reshaper = arabic_reshaper.ArabicReshaper(configuration=configuration)
   ```

4. **Simplified RTL Marking:**
   - Reduced excess RTL marks that were causing layout issues
   - Applied a single RTL mark at the beginning of lines containing Farsi

### **Components Modified:**

1. **vocabulary_loader.py:**
   - Added the central `normalize_farsi` function
   - Configured proper reshaping for Farsi characters

2. **models.py:**
   - Updated Item, NPC, and Room classes to use the centralized function
   - Fixed the Room description setter to properly handle Farsi words

3. **ui.py:**
   - Updated GameLog to use the centralized function
   - Improved how mixed Farsi/English text is displayed

### **Results:**
The improvements resulted in:
- Properly connected Farsi letters in all displayed text
- Consistent appearance across all game components
- Correct text directionality for mixed Farsi/English content

### **Lessons Learned:**
1. When working with bidirectional text, the order of processing operations is crucial
2. Centralizing text processing functions helps maintain consistency
3. Custom configuration for language-specific tools (like arabic_reshaper) can significantly improve results
4. Testing on the actual target display environment is essential for detecting subtle rendering issues

### **Next Steps:**
1. Consider adding support for more advanced Farsi typography features
2. Implement automated tests for text processing
3. Optimize performance of text processing for longer text sections
4. Create documentation specifically focused on the Farsi text handling
