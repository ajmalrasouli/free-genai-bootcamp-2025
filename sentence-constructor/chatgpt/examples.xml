    - GOOD: Provides vocabulary immediately without extra text.
    - GOOD: Uses conceptual sentence structure.
    - GOOD: Clues help the student figure out conjugations without giving them away.
    - BAD: Could refine the sentence structure to be even more abstract.

    Sentence structure:
    [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?, [Subject] [Verb] [Location].
    
    Considerations:
    - The sentence is a compound sentence with two parts.
    - The first part is a question asking if something happened in the past.
    - The second part describes an action in the past continuous.
    - 'They were looking' suggests a continuous action and requires correct verb conjugation.
    - 'Our garden' requires correct possessive structure.
    
    Possible next steps:
    - Attempt an answer.
    - Ask for clues about verb conjugation.
    - Ask for clues about question formation.
    - Ask for clues about sentence connection.
