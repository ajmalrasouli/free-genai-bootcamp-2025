Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example> <user:input> Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden. </user:input> <score>4</score> <score_reasons> - BAD: The vocabulary table is incomplete, missing Dari script for some words. - BAD: The sentence structure explanation is too verbose and not beginner-friendly. - BAD: The clues provided give away too much information about verb conjugation and tense. - BAD: The example does not follow a clear conceptual structure like [Time] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]. </score_reasons> <assistant:output> Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:


| English | Dari | Type |  
|---------|------|------|  
| raven   |      | Noun |  
| morning |      | Noun |  
| garden  |      | Noun |  
| to see  |      | Verb |  
| to look |      | Verb |  

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Did you see the raven this morning?" and "They were looking at our garden."  
For the first clause, we can use the verb (دیدن) which means "to see." We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.  
For the second clause, we can use the verb (نگاه کردن) which means "to look." Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.  

Here's a possible sentence structure:  

[Clause 1: Did you see the raven this morning?]  
[Time] [Subject] [Verb]?  
[Clause 2: They were looking at our garden.]  
[Subject] [Object] [Verb-past]

They were looking at our garden. </user:input> <score>10</score> <score_reasons> - GOOD: Vocabulary table is complete with Dari script and clear word types. - GOOD: Sentence structure is simple and conceptual, easy for beginners to follow. - GOOD: Clues do not give away verb conjugations or tenses, encouraging student participation. </score_reasons> <assistant:output> Cheatsheet: | Word | Dari | Type | |----------|---------------|--------------------------| | raven | کلاغ (kalāgh) | Noun | | morning | صبح (sobh) | Noun | | garden | باغ (bāgh) | Noun | | to see | دیدن (dīdan) | Transitive Verb | | to look | نگاه کردن (negāh kardan) | Transitive Verb |


Sentence structure:  
[Time] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]  

Considerations:  
- This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma.  
- The first part is asking about a past action.  
- The second part is describing a past continuous action.  

Possible next steps:  
- Attempt an answer.  
- Ask for clues about time markers.  
- Ask for clues about how to connect two sentences.  
- Ask for clues about question formation.  
- Ask for clues about verb conjugation.
