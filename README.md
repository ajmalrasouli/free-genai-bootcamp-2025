This repository contains projects developed during the 2025 GenAI Bootcamp [Free GenAI Bootcamp](https://genai.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/), focusing on practical applications of generative AI and language technologies, particularly for Persian/Dari language learning. All projects are designed to be run via Docker Compose from the central `Launcher` directory.

## 🏗️ GenAI System Architecture

![GenAI Architecture](genai-architecting/genai-architecture.png)

*This architecture diagram illustrates our approach to building a cost-effective, privacy-focused AI system for language learning. We've designed this solution around open-source models (like IBM Granite) that can run on dedicated AI hardware, avoiding ongoing API costs while maintaining control over student data. The system supports 300 simultaneous users and integrates our own proprietary learning materials to address copyright concerns. This self-hosted approach offers the perfect balance of performance, privacy, and long-term sustainability for language education.*

## Getting Started

This project uses Docker Compose to manage and run all the different services. The **Launcher service** (`http://localhost:3000`) acts as the central dashboard to view the status of and access all the other learning applications.

**It is recommended to run all projects via the Launcher's Docker Compose setup.**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    *   Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (often included with Docker Desktop).
    *   Ensure you have any necessary API keys (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Writing Practice) and potentially accounts for services like Azure Speech (for Listening Comp).
    *   Ability to run Python scripts locally for project-specific setup (e.g., training the ASL model in `finger-spelling` by following its README).

2.  **Configuration:**
    *   **Navigate to the `Launcher` directory.** This is the main directory for controlling all services.
    *   Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.template` (`cp .env.template .env`).
    *   Edit the `Launcher/.env` file and add your required API keys (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`). This file provides environment variables to all services started by the compose file.

3.  **Build and Run All Services:**
    *   **From the `Launcher` directory,** run:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```
    *   This command will build the images for all services (which might take some time on the first run) and start them in the background.

4.  **Access the Launcher Dashboard:**
    *   Open your web browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   This dashboard shows the status of each service and provides links to launch them.

5.  **Launch Projects:**
    *   From the Launcher Dashboard, click the link for a project.
    *   This will open the project's specific URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8009` for Language Learning Portal, `http://localhost:8008` for Writing Practice) in a new tab.

6.  **Managing Services:**
    *   **Use your terminal in the `Launcher` directory** to manage the services:
    *   To stop all services: `docker-compose down`.
    *   To start/stop individual services: `docker-compose start <service_name>` or `docker-compose stop <service_name>`.
    *   To view logs: `docker-compose logs <service_name>`.
